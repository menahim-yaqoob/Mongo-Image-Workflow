This GitHub repository documents a practical Docker workflow for managing a MongoDB container. The process begins with the docker pull mongo command, which downloads the official MongoDB image from Docker Hub, establishing the foundational layer for the environment.

Following the download, the user successfully creates and runs a container from this image, which is verified by the docker ps command. The output of this command confirms that a container named mongocontainer is active, and the MongoDB service is running and exposed on port 27017/tcp.

The final stage of the workflow demonstrates an attempt to interact with the running container using the docker exec command to access the Mongo shell. Although this specific attempt encounters a "command not found" error—a common issue when the full client tools aren't included in the base image—it serves as a crucial learning point. This part of the repository highlights a typical troubleshooting scenario, providing a valuable example for users who might face similar challenges while working with containerized applications.
